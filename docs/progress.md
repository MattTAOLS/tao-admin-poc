- 2026-11-03 — Data & API: wave 1b schema parity. Merged lead/wave1-seams. `api/app/models.py` now matches migration 001
  for raw-SQL writers (worker/validate): the five timestamp columns have `server_default=now()` as well as the Python
  default, and ids are stored on SQLite as the dashed 36-character text PostgreSQL prints (was 32-char hex, so raw
  updates by the API's id matched 0 rows). New `tests/test_schema_parity.py` inserts an extraction with raw SQL (dashed
  upload id, no created_at) and reads it back through the API; it fails on the old models. 111 passed on SQLite and on
  PostgreSQL 16 built from db/migrations. Existing SQLite files built by the old models must be deleted and re-seeded.
- 2026-11-03 — Data & API: wave 1 deliverables 1–7. All 23 operations in `contracts/openapi.yaml` are real and backed by
  the database (SQLAlchemy models over 001 + new migrations 002/003). Seed: `python -m app.seed` loads seed/*.json
  idempotently; `--reference-publications` also publishes the 12 real deal objects for the partner portals. Uploads store
  the PDF under `FILE_STORE/uploads/<id>/source.pdf`, count pages with pypdfium2, push `{"upload_id","pass":1}` to
  `extract:jobs`, refuse a published period (R12, 409). Override resolves the finding, writes `override`/`restate` to the
  audit, re-runs `rules.run()` and merges findings (ids and resolutions survive). Approve refuses while a block finding is
  open, writes the publication and approve/publish/regenerate audit entries. Page images render at 110 dpi and are cached.
  Program roll-up (`api/app/rollup.py`) reproduces both real program files total for total and is computed on read.
  Partner scoping is `partner_filter` + `visible_programs` in `api/app/main.py`; another partner's program or deal is a 404.
  Run: from `api/`, `python -m pytest -q` (110 tests, SQLite); `TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+pg8000://...` runs the same
  suite on PostgreSQL built from `db/migrations` (110 passed against postgres:16-alpine). Stubbed: regenerate only bumps
  `rollup_version` and audits (roll-ups are never stale); `actor_label` is the role until real sign-in. Needs: compose mount
  for the demo seed, contract fold-in of extra fields/errors, worker status/row conventions (all in `docs/requests.md`).
- 2026-11-03 — Lead: wave-1 seam decisions (branch lead/wave1-seams). Roll-forward terms: `charge_off` is the one
  name for the page-2 NPV adjustment (column i), already in the reference data; `new_funded` (+) and
  `ineligible_buyback` (−) are new optional period_history fields, all positive amounts. R05 is now opening +
  new_funded − principal − prepayments − losses − charge_off − ineligible_buyback. `covenants[].reported_triggered`
  (YES/NO) is in the schema and R18 uses it. rules.yaml also takes Rules' R03 range, R09 fn and R18 floor band.
  Compose: worker runs `python main.py` from /app (imports `extract`, `validate`, `rules`); api mounts
  docs/dashboard-json for the demo seed. Worker hand-off: worker/validate owns every database write
  (`mark_extracting`, `handle_extraction`, `mark_failed`); worker/main.py calls them.
- 2026-11-03 — Design System: wave 1 delivered on `agent/design`.
  Built: `web/src/design/components` (import everything from `@/design/components`): Button (primary / ghost /
  danger, sm, icon, loading), StatusPill plus UploadStatusPill / SeverityPill / FindingStatusPill / CovenantPill with
  the contract vocabularies mapped once (UPLOAD_STATUS, UPLOAD_TERMINAL for the 2 s polling stop, SEVERITY,
  FINDING_STATUS, COVENANT_STATUS incl. AVAILABLE), Card, KpiTile + KpiRow, DataTable (sticky header under the top bar,
  numeric columns right-aligned tabular, sort, row expand with controlled Expand all, clickable rows, footer totals,
  empty state, skeleton rows, compact density, fixed-height scroll), FindingCard (renders a finding.schema.json object
  as is: rule id, severity, status, message, ours / report / difference / tolerance by unit, context arithmetic,
  source page, resolution; crop slot and action slot), Field + Input / Select (grouped options) / Textarea, FileDrop
  (accept + size validation, keyboard), ToastProvider + useToast (bottom-right, 6 s, pause on hover, max 3), Dialog
  (focus trap, Escape, focus return, alertdialog, non-dismissable while busy), Breadcrumb, SkeletonBlock, PageHeader,
  StatePanel (empty / error / no-access / not-found), format helpers (formatCurrency, formatPercent, formatNumber,
  formatSigned, formatPeriod, formatByUnit, formatDiffByUnit), inline SVG `icons`.
  Shell (`web/src/shell`): user-card role switcher in the sidebar footer (menu, arrows / Enter / Escape), Workspace /
  Account nav with icons, top bar = PageHeader fed by `usePageHeader()` from `@/shell/header`, breadcrumb derived from
  the registry, lazy page registration via `load` in `pages.ts` with a route progress bar + skeleton, page transition
  on the content column only, StatePanel no-access and not-found (with Go to home), ToastProvider around the app,
  `--ds-sticky-top` published for table headers, print stylesheet hides sidebar and actions.
  Run: `cd web && npm install && npm test` (115 tests incl. a tokens-only lint over design/ and shell/),
  `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, `npm run storybook` (:6006) or `npm run build-storybook`. Stories use the real
  program JSON in docs/dashboard-json and the R05 finding fixture; nothing invented.
  Stubbed: no page components (UI agents); FindingCard page crop is a slot the page fills from
  `/uploads/{id}/pages/{n}.png`. Not checked in a browser by me (no dev server reachable from my session); the
  Storybook build and jsdom tests pass. Needs: see Design System in docs/requests.md (package.json, .storybook owner,
  make check running the web suite).
- 2026-11-03 — Extraction: wave 1b seams (merged lead/wave1-seams). The page-2 NPV adjustment is emitted as
  `period_history[].charge_off`; `new_funded` and `ineligible_buyback` stay, positive amounts, only where the
  layout prints them (Moneda: charge_off; Stride: new_funded, ineligible_buyback; Xpedite: none). All 12
  extractions validate and close the new R05 identity within $1 (tested directly until Rules' checks.py lands).
  `worker/main.py handle()` calls validate's mark_extracting / handle_extraction / mark_failed, keeps writing
  `extraction-pass<n>.json`, and falls back to disk-only without the adapter; tests cover success, pass 2,
  extraction failure and hand-off failure with fakes, plus a `python main.py`-style import from worker/.
  Requirements: `worker/requirements.txt` (runtime) and `worker/requirements-dev.txt` (pytest, pypdf).
  Run: `pip install -r worker/requirements-dev.txt && python -m pytest -q worker/extract/tests`.
- 2026-11-03 — Extraction: wave 1 deliverables 1–6 on `agent/extraction`. `extract(pdf, template_id, pages=None)`
  in `worker/extract/` reads the text layer with pdfplumber (repairs Excel's phantom spaces inside numbers,
  detects negative signs by geometry, aligns blank cells by column edges), parses sections by heading through
  `templates/fpil-2.0-settrep-v1.yaml`, derives the dashboard fields (current period rows, ratio_history,
  cnl_by_period with limits, covenants with status/trend/utilization, summary, financial_ratios) and records a
  source (page, bbox, raw text) for every leaf. Result: the 3 F-PIL reference objects reproduced field for field
  from their PDFs (`history.chain` over the 4 reports per deal; tolerance $0.01 / 0.0001), every one of the 12
  PDFs matches its period's rows, all pass phase-1 rules with no block finding, and a copy of Moneda 202608 with
  one digit changed on page 2 fails R05 by exactly −100.00. Claude fallback (`ANTHROPIC_MODEL`) is asked only
  for unplaced cells, JSON-validated, every call logged; the 12 samples need none. Pass 2 re-reads named pages
  and returns a patch (`merge_patch` applies it). `worker/main.py` runs jobs and hands off to `worker/validate`.
  Run: `python -m pytest -q worker/extract/tests` (≈2 min; sample tests skip without `data/samples/`);
  `python -m worker.extract.compare <pdf> <reference.dashboard.json>`. Stubbed: OCR fallback (pages without
  text are listed in `meta.pages_without_text`), MOVE Trust template, the validate hand-off. Needs: see
  docs/requests.md › Extraction (pypdf, compose worker path, R05 extra terms, reference quirks).
- 2026-11-03 — Rules, wave 1b (seams): merged lead/wave1-seams. R09 resolves from rules.yaml (FN_FALLBACK gone).
  R05 adds `new_funded` (+) and `ineligible_buyback` (−) beside `charge_off`, named in context and message when
  non-zero; R18 checks `covenants[].reported_triggered` (YES ⇔ BREACH). New fixtures r05-new-funded,
  r05-ineligible-buyback, r18-reported-triggered (Moneda, SLFA 9.1 (h) answered YES at ICR 1.27 vs 1.10).
  `worker/validate` now owns the worker's database writes: `mark_extracting`, `handle_extraction` (extraction row,
  reporting_period, findings, pass-2 enqueue on retryable block findings or needs_review, pass-1 findings marked
  resolved_by_pass_2), `mark_failed` (status + audit row); opens its own transaction on DATABASE_URL when no
  connection is passed. `build_context` returns the API's override Context shape. Run: `cd rules && python -m pytest -q`
  (75), `cd worker/validate && python -m pytest -q` (12, SQLite). Not tested on PostgreSQL here (no libpq locally).
  Needs: worker/main.py to call the three functions (Extraction); AuditEntry.action decision; earlier open items
  (Stride/Xpedite covenant seed, deal facility limit, `make check` line).
- 2026-11-03 — Rules: every phase-1 and phase-2 rule implemented in `rules/checks.py` (R01–R15, R17–R19); R16 and
  R20–R22 (phase 3) not implemented. Each has `rules/tests/fixtures/<rule>-pass.json` / `-fail.json` (a real deal
  object plus one recorded change, generated by `make_fixtures.py`) and frozen expected findings under
  `fixtures/findings/`. On the 12 reference deals with seeded master data: no block findings except R05 on Finloc
  and TLFC LP (Meridian now closes: R05 subtracts its NPV adjustment `charge_off`); R18 reproduces every
  ceiling/floor status, worst_status and covenant_summary; one review finding pair (R14 on Stride, seed issue);
  one R19 note (Essex ICR OK → WATCH). `run()` over one deal ≈ 25–70 ms. `worker/validate/`: `SqlStore` +
  `validate_extraction(store, extraction_id)` builds prior / master / published periods / upload from the
  database, plus `retry_pages`, `resolved_by_pass_2`, `counts`, `insert_findings`. Run:
  `cd rules && python -m pytest -q` (72) and `cd worker/validate && python -m pytest -q` (6). Stubbed / limited:
  R02 has no report currency field to read except Finloc's by_currency; R10 and R17 compare multiples to the
  printed ratio history (no EBITDA / interest captured); R17 skips "(Definitions)" trigger tests; R15 lacks a
  deal-level facility limit; R18 cannot check page-14 YES / NO. Needs: see `docs/requests.md` › Rules (R09 `fn`,
  R05 / R18 / R03 wording, Stride/Xpedite covenant seed, deal facility limit, worker mount path, `make check` line).
- 2026-11-03 — Lead: day-0 scaffold. Contracts (OpenAPI 19 routes, extraction + finding schemas, 22 rules as
  data, tokens, motion), compose with five services, API role gates with tests, rules engine with R01/R05/R07 and
  reference-data tests, web shell with role switcher and every portal-map page routed, seed data, agent briefs.
  Findings from real data: F-PIL and six MOVE Trust deals close their roll-forward to the cent; three MOVE Trust
  deals do not (see rules tests); two aging conventions exist.
