- 2026-11-03 — Design System: wave 1 delivered on `agent/design`.
  Built: `web/src/design/components` (import everything from `@/design/components`): Button (primary / ghost /
  danger, sm, icon, loading), StatusPill plus UploadStatusPill / SeverityPill / FindingStatusPill / CovenantPill with
  the contract vocabularies mapped once (UPLOAD_STATUS, UPLOAD_TERMINAL for the 2 s polling stop, SEVERITY,
  FINDING_STATUS, COVENANT_STATUS incl. AVAILABLE), Card, KpiTile + KpiRow, DataTable (sticky header under the top bar,
  numeric columns right-aligned tabular, sort, row expand with controlled Expand all, clickable rows, footer totals,
  empty state, skeleton rows, compact density, fixed-height scroll), FindingCard (renders a finding.schema.json object
  as is: rule id, severity, status, message, ours / report / difference / tolerance by unit, context arithmetic,
  source page, resolution; crop slot and action slot), Field + Input / Select (grouped options) / Textarea, FileDrop
  (accept + size validation, keyboard), ToastProvider + useToast (bottom-right, 6 s, pause on hover, max 3), Dialog
  (focus trap, Escape, focus return, alertdialog, non-dismissable while busy), Breadcrumb, SkeletonBlock, PageHeader,
  StatePanel (empty / error / no-access / not-found), format helpers (formatCurrency, formatPercent, formatNumber,
  formatSigned, formatPeriod, formatByUnit, formatDiffByUnit), inline SVG `icons`.
  Shell (`web/src/shell`): user-card role switcher in the sidebar footer (menu, arrows / Enter / Escape), Workspace /
  Account nav with icons, top bar = PageHeader fed by `usePageHeader()` from `@/shell/header`, breadcrumb derived from
  the registry, lazy page registration via `load` in `pages.ts` with a route progress bar + skeleton, page transition
  on the content column only, StatePanel no-access and not-found (with Go to home), ToastProvider around the app,
  `--ds-sticky-top` published for table headers, print stylesheet hides sidebar and actions.
  Run: `cd web && npm install && npm test` (115 tests incl. a tokens-only lint over design/ and shell/),
  `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, `npm run storybook` (:6006) or `npm run build-storybook`. Stories use the real
  program JSON in docs/dashboard-json and the R05 finding fixture; nothing invented.
  Stubbed: no page components (UI agents); FindingCard page crop is a slot the page fills from
  `/uploads/{id}/pages/{n}.png`. Not checked in a browser by me (no dev server reachable from my session); the
  Storybook build and jsdom tests pass. Needs: see Design System in docs/requests.md (package.json, .storybook owner,
  make check running the web suite).
- 2026-11-03 — Lead: day-0 scaffold. Contracts (OpenAPI 19 routes, extraction + finding schemas, 22 rules as
  data, tokens, motion), compose with five services, API role gates with tests, rules engine with R01/R05/R07 and
  reference-data tests, web shell with role switcher and every portal-map page routed, seed data, agent briefs.
  Findings from real data: F-PIL and six MOVE Trust deals close their roll-forward to the cent; three MOVE Trust
  deals do not (see rules tests); two aging conventions exist.
